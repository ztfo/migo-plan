# Mo Plugin - Enhanced Features Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the expanded scope and enhanced features for the Mo plugin, focusing on creating a more integrated experience with Linear and providing a UI within Cursor IDE.

## Core Enhancement Areas

### 1. In-Cursor UI Interface
- **Task Queue Dashboard**: A panel within Cursor to review, edit, and manage tasks before pushing to Linear
- **Linear Sync Panel**: Visual interface for syncing with Linear, viewing recent issues, and managing project status
- **Quick Actions Bar**: Shortcuts for common actions like creating tasks, planning features, and updating status

### 2. Enhanced Linear Integration
- **Full API Utilization**: Leverage more Linear API features including:
  - Projects management
  - Cycles/sprints
  - Labels and priorities
  - Comments and attachments
  - User assignments
  - Custom fields
- **Two-way Sync**: Changes in Linear reflected in Cursor UI and vice versa
- **Bulk Operations**: Create/update multiple issues at once
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter issues by various criteria (status, assignee, priority, etc.)

### 3. AI-Enhanced Project Management
- **Smarter Task Generation**: More context-aware task breakdown with code references
- **Effort Estimation**: AI-suggested story points or time estimates
- **Dependency Detection**: Suggest task dependencies based on feature requirements
- **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate technical specs from feature plans

### 4. Developer Experience Improvements
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Recommend tasks based on current code context
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of project progress within Cursor
- **Notifications**: Alerts for assigned tasks, status changes, etc.
- **Code-to-Task Linking**: Connect code changes to specific Linear issues

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Basic UI
- Create UI framework within Cursor
- Implement task queue functionality
- Enhance Linear API integration for more issue properties
- Build settings panel for configuration

### Phase 2: Advanced Linear Integration
- Implement projects and cycles integration
- Add support for labels, priorities, and custom fields
- Build two-way sync capabilities
- Create bulk operations functionality

### Phase 3: AI Enhancements
- Improve task generation with code context
- Add effort estimation capabilities
- Implement dependency detection
- Build documentation generation features

### Phase 4: Polish & Advanced Features
- Add notifications system
- Implement code-to-task linking
- Create advanced filtering and search
- Add data visualization for project metrics

## UI Components Specification

### Task Queue Panel
- **Task List**: Sortable, filterable list of pending tasks
- **Edit Controls**: Ability to modify task details before pushing to Linear
- **Batch Actions**: Select multiple tasks for bulk operations
- **Preview**: See how tasks will appear in Linear

### Linear Sync Panel
- **Status Overview**: Quick view of project status, recent activity
- **Issue Browser**: Browse and search Linear issues
- **Quick Edit**: Make changes to existing issues
- **Sync Controls**: Manual and automatic sync options

### Settings Panel
- **API Configuration**: Linear API key and team settings
- **UI Preferences**: Customize appearance and behavior
- **Automation Settings**: Configure automatic syncs and notifications
- **AI Configuration**: Adjust AI behavior for task generation

## Technical Considerations

### Cursor Extension API
- Investigate available UI capabilities in Cursor extension API
- Determine best approach for persistent panels vs. command-triggered UI
- Explore options for background processes and notifications

### Linear API Usage
- Review complete Linear GraphQL API documentation
- Identify optimal query patterns for efficient data fetching
- Implement proper caching to reduce API calls
- Handle rate limiting and authentication edge cases

### Data Management
- Design local storage strategy for task queue
- Implement conflict resolution for two-way sync
- Create robust error handling for API failures
- Consider offline capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed mockups for UI components
2. Set up Linear projects to track implementation of these features
3. Prioritize features based on development complexity and user value
4. Develop proof-of-concept for key technical challenges
