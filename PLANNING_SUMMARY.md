4. **Updated README.md**: Revised to reflect the expanded vision for the plugin

5. **Updated SETTINGS.md**: Enhanced with additional configuration options for the expanded features

## Linear Project Created

A project has been created in Linear to track the implementation of these features:

- **Project Name**: Mo Plugin Enhancements
- **Project URL**: https://linear.app/built-with-words/project/mo-plugin-enhancements-c12f78b69ad4
- **Tasks Created**: 16 issues representing the implementation tasks across 4 phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Basic UI
- Set up UI framework within Cursor
- Implement task queue functionality
- Enhance Linear API for more issue properties
- Build settings panel for configuration

### Phase 2: Advanced Linear Integration
- Implement projects and cycles integration
- Add support for labels, priorities, and custom fields
- Build two-way sync capabilities
- Create bulk operations functionality

### Phase 3: AI Enhancements
- Improve task generation with code context
- Add effort estimation capabilities
- Implement dependency detection
- Build documentation generation features

### Phase 4: Polish & Advanced Features
- Add notifications system
- Implement code-to-task linking
- Create advanced filtering and search
- Add data visualization for project metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Implementation**: Start with Phase 1 tasks, focusing on the UI framework and task queue functionality
2. **Research Cursor Extension API**: Investigate the capabilities and limitations of the Cursor extension API for UI implementation
3. **Expand Linear API Integration**: Implement the enhanced Linear API functions
4. **Create UI Mockups**: Design detailed mockups for the UI components
5. **Set Up Testing Infrastructure**: Prepare for testing the new features
