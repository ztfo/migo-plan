# Mo Plugin UI Specification

## Overview

This document provides technical specifications for the Mo plugin's UI components within Cursor IDE. The UI will provide a visual interface for managing tasks, syncing with Linear, and configuring the plugin.

## UI Architecture

### Integration with Cursor

The Mo plugin UI will be implemented using Cursor's extension API. Based on current understanding of Cursor's extension capabilities, we'll use a combination of:

1. **Webview Panels**: For rich, interactive UI components
2. **Status Bar Items**: For quick access to common actions
3. **Command Palette**: For executing commands
4. **Notifications**: For alerts and updates

### UI Components Hierarchy

## Component Specifications

### Task Queue Panel

**Purpose**: Allow users to review, edit, and manage tasks before pushing to Linear.

**Implementation Details**:
- Implemented as a Webview panel
- Persists task data in local storage
- Provides drag-and-drop reordering of tasks
- Includes batch editing capabilities

**UI Elements**:
- Task list with columns for title, description, priority, etc.
- Edit form for modifying task details
- Batch action buttons (delete, push, edit)
- Filter and sort controls
- Push to Linear button

**Data Flow**:
1. Tasks generated from AI are added to the queue
2. User can edit, reorder, or delete tasks
3. User pushes tasks to Linear individually or in batch
4. Successful pushes remove tasks from the queue

### Linear Sync Panel

**Purpose**: Provide a visual interface for viewing and managing Linear issues.

**Implementation Details**:
- Implemented as a Webview panel
- Caches Linear data locally for performance
- Implements pagination for large datasets
- Provides real-time updates when possible

**UI Elements**:
- Status overview showing counts by state
- Issue list with filtering and sorting
- Quick edit form for modifying issues
- Sync status indicator
- Manual sync button

**Data Flow**:
1. Panel loads cached data initially
2. Background sync updates data periodically
3. User can trigger manual sync
4. Changes made in the panel are pushed to Linear
5. Changes from Linear are pulled into the panel

### Settings Panel

**Purpose**: Allow users to configure the plugin.

**Implementation Details**:
- Implemented as a Webview panel
- Saves settings to extension storage
- Validates input before saving
- Provides reset to defaults option

**UI Elements**:
- API configuration form
- UI preference toggles and selectors
- Automation settings controls
- AI configuration options

**Data Flow**:
1. Panel loads current settings
2. User modifies settings
3. Settings are validated and saved
4. Plugin components are updated to reflect new settings

### Status Bar

**Purpose**: Provide quick access to common actions and status information.

**Implementation Details**:
- Implemented using Cursor's status bar API
- Updates dynamically based on plugin state
- Provides clickable actions

**UI Elements**:
- Quick action buttons (create task, sync, etc.)
- Sync status indicator
- Task count badge

**Data Flow**:
1. Status bar items update based on plugin state
2. User clicks on status bar items to trigger actions
3. Actions open relevant panels or execute commands

## UI States and Transitions

### Task Queue States
1. **Empty**: No tasks in queue
2. **Populated**: Tasks in queue
3. **Editing**: User editing a task
4. **Pushing**: Tasks being pushed to Linear
5. **Error**: Error occurred during operation

### Linear Sync States
1. **Disconnected**: Not connected to Linear
2. **Connecting**: Establishing connection
3. **Syncing**: Syncing data with Linear
4. **Synced**: Data in sync with Linear
5. **Error**: Error occurred during sync

### Settings States
1. **Viewing**: User viewing settings
2. **Editing**: User editing settings
3. **Saving**: Settings being saved
4. **Error**: Error occurred during save

## Interaction Patterns

### Task Creation Flow
1. User triggers task creation (via command or UI)
2. AI generates task suggestions
3. Tasks appear in Task Queue Panel
4. User reviews and edits tasks
5. User pushes tasks to Linear

### Issue Management Flow
1. User opens Linear Sync Panel
2. Panel displays issues from Linear
3. User filters or searches for specific issues
4. User edits issue details
5. Changes are synced back to Linear

### Configuration Flow
1. User opens Settings Panel
2. User modifies settings
3. Settings are validated and saved
4. Plugin behavior updates accordingly

## Visual Design Guidelines

### Color Scheme
- Primary: #5E6AD2 (Linear brand color)
- Secondary: #F2C94C
- Success: #27AE60
- Error: #EB5757
- Background: #FFFFFF (light) / #1E1E1E (dark)
- Text: #333333 (light) / #E1E1E1 (dark)

### Typography
- Font: System font stack
- Headings: 16px, 14px, 12px
- Body: 12px
- Monospace: 12px (for code elements)

### Layout
- Responsive design that adapts to panel size
- Consistent padding and spacing
- Grid-based alignment
- Collapsible sections for complex forms

## Accessibility Considerations

- Keyboard navigation for all UI elements
- ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast
- Focus indicators for interactive elements
- Error messages that are clear and descriptive

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Framework
- Set up Webview infrastructure
- Implement basic Task Queue Panel
- Add status bar integration

### Phase 2: Linear Integration
- Implement Linear Sync Panel
- Add two-way sync capabilities
- Enhance Task Queue with Linear integration

### Phase 3: Settings and Configuration
- Implement Settings Panel
- Add user preference storage
- Create configuration validation

### Phase 4: Polish and Refinement
- Add animations and transitions
- Implement error handling and recovery
- Optimize performance
- Add keyboard shortcuts

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Limited Cursor Extension API
**Solution**: Use a combination of available APIs creatively, potentially with workarounds for limitations.

### Challenge: Performance with Large Datasets
**Solution**: Implement pagination, virtualized lists, and efficient caching strategies.

### Challenge: Offline Support
**Solution**: Use local storage for caching and implement sync queue for offline changes.

### Challenge: UI Consistency Across Themes
**Solution**: Use theme-aware styling and test with all Cursor themes.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for UI logic
- Integration tests for Linear API interaction
- Visual regression tests for UI components
- User testing for workflow validation
