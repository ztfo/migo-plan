## Feature: Linear-Centric Project Management
_Planned: 2025-03-08_

### Description:
Based on our investigation of Cursor's extension capabilities, we're implementing a Linear-centric approach to project management. This approach focuses on using Linear as the source of truth for all task information, with rich context generation and flexible ways to share context with Cursor AI.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Planning Interface**
  - [ ] Create webview panel for project planning
  - [ ] Implement rich text editor for project descriptions
  - [ ] Build AI integration for task generation with rich context
  - [ ] Develop task list and detail editor
  - [ ] Implement Linear push functionality

- [ ] **Task Sidebar**
  - [ ] Create tree view for Linear tasks
  - [ ] Implement Linear data fetching and caching
  - [ ] Build task detail view with context display
  - [ ] Add copy to clipboard functionality
  - [ ] Implement task status update controls
  - [ ] Create task filtering and search

- [ ] **Export Functionality**
  - [ ] Create export dialog webview
  - [ ] Implement file generation system
  - [ ] Build directory structure creation
  - [ ] Add export configuration options
  - [ ] Develop task selection mechanism

- [ ] **Integration and Polish**
  - [ ] Add status bar items for quick access
  - [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts
  - [ ] Create comprehensive error handling
  - [ ] Add progress indicators
  - [ ] Improve performance and responsiveness

- [ ] **Documentation and Testing**
  - [ ] Create user documentation
  - [ ] Develop comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] Perform user testing and gather feedback
  - [ ] Create sample projects for demonstration

### Implementation Strategy:

1. **Linear Integration**:
   - Use Linear's GraphQL API for efficient data fetching
   - Implement proper caching to reduce API calls
   - Create rich issue descriptions with markdown formatting
   - Maintain two-way sync between extension and Linear

2. **Context Generation**:
   - Create structured templates for consistent context
   - Include project-wide technology and framework information
   - Generate detailed technical specifications for each task
   - Maintain consistency in terminology and approach
   - Include UX patterns and design guidelines

3. **Context Sharing**:
   - Provide copy to clipboard functionality for easy sharing
   - Implement flexible export to markdown files
   - Create organized directory structure for exported files
   - Allow selective export of specific tasks

4. **User Experience**:
   - Create intuitive planning interface
   - Provide quick access to tasks through sidebar
   - Implement clear status indicators
   - Add helpful tooltips and guidance
   - Create responsive and performant UI

### Technical Architecture:

1. **Core Components**:
   - `PlanningManager`: Handles project planning and AI integration
   - `LinearClient`: Manages communication with Linear API
   - `TaskExporter`: Handles file generation and export
   - `SidebarProvider`: Manages tree view and task display

2. **Data Flow**:
   - User creates project plan in planning interface
   - AI generates tasks with rich context
   - Tasks are pushed to Linear
   - Sidebar pulls tasks from Linear
   - User can copy context or export to files
   - Updates sync back to Linear

3. **Extension Structure**:
   - Use standard VS Code extension activation
   - Register commands through VS Code API
   - Create webview providers for rich interfaces
   - Implement tree data providers for sidebar
   - Add status bar items for quick access
